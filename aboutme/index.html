  <h2>Emily Keele</h2>
  <p> Hi there! My name is Emily Keele and I'm married with four children. I teach full time at the Logan/USU Insitute. I'm also currently in a PhD program at USU but I need to learn web development for side project I'm passionate about.</p>
  <p> I have taken classes through BYUI Online for several years both "for fun" or to fulfill prerequisite requirements. I have loved all my BYUI online experiences.</p>
  <p> I have a Bachelor's degree in Communications from BYU, a Master's Degree in Business Adminstration from SUU, and my PhD will be in Career and Technical Education.</p>
  <p> I have been a member of the Church my entire life. My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 17:51. If the Lord can instruct Nephi on how to build a ship, surely He can instruct me in how to accomplish the things I desire to do for good</p>
<p> I also have a dog that drives me crazy with his disobedience but I love him to pieces... go figure.</p>
